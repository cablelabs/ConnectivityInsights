    With CAMARA Connectivity Insights, application developers gain essential
    visibility into network quality. This enables them to make informed
    decisions that enhance the end-user experience for their applications.

    # Introduction
      The Connectivity Insights API allows an application developer to ask
      the network the likelihood that an application's networking
      requirements can be met for a given end user session.

      This information helps a developer ensure their end users are able to
      get the best experience while using the application over their current
      network.

      Depending on the answer the network gives, the developer may decide to
      request a network boost (via the CAMARA QoD API) , and/or apply
      specific changes on the application side e.g. adjusting the
      resolution of the video stream upwards or downwards.


    # API functionality

    Prerequisite: authorisation and authentication

    Usage:
      1. create an application profile using the Connectivity Insights
      `application-profiles` API
      2. Request: POST `check-network-quality`, passing the
      `applicationProfileId` obtained in step 1, the address/port of an
      application server, and at least one device identifier.
      3. Response: The network will indicate whether it can or cannot meet
      the application requirements.
      3. Optional: use the `connectivity-insights-subscriptions` API to receive
      notifications of network quality.

    # Identifying the device

    This can be achieved either by passing at least one  device identifier in
    the POST request body, or, from the 3-legged access token where implemented
    by the operator.

    Device identifiers in POST request body:
      * `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address`. This is the public IP address of the
      user device: this
      can be obtained by an application hosted on that device calling a
      public IP address API (e.g. GET https://api.ipify.org?format=json)
      * If you provide an `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address`: for certain
      operators you may be required to also provide a `Public-port` header.
      * `Phone-Number` . The international E.164 format (starting with country
      code), e.g. +4407123123456
      * `Network-Access-Identifier` (where available from the API host
      operator)

    NOTE1: the network operators might support only a subset of these options.
    The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across
    different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to
    the same device.

    NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the
    `networkAccessIdentifier` is only part of the schema for future-proofing,
    and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release
    work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to
    be explicitly documented in the guidelines.


    # Authorization and Authentication

      The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on
      how a client requests an access token. Please refer to
      Identify and Consent Management
      (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the
      released version of the Profile.

      Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined
      during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco
      Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for
      accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal
      framework dictated by local legislation.

      It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is
      processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through
      mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access
      tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in
      strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory
      obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric
      data control.

        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP

        (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device
        (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from
        some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is
        not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both
        publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its
        publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6
        address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one
        of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known.
        In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4
        address alone.
